# CIFAR-10 Classifier in PyTorch

A custom solution implemented from scratch in PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (CNN and SVM).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- CNN built without pre-trained models  (above 85% accuracy)
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)   
- Includes training & validation accuracy tracking  
- Simple and readable code structure
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation for comparison (only around 58% accuracy)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
